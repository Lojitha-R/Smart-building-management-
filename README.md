# Smart-building-management
There is a critical need for a smart building management system that integrates Iot, data analytics, and automation to monitor, analyse, and optimize building operations in real timeâ€”enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving the overall occupant experience.
so the goal is to understand the needs of the problems of the users who live or working in the buildings.
The key requirements are 1.	Energy efficient management system 2. security and access control 3. climate control 4. lighting control and 5.fire safety management system
Core problems to solve are: energy efficiency and sustainability, occupant comfort, security and data management.
Implementation: ai model development, chatbot development, iot device integration, data security and implementation, testing feedback and validation.
The challenges will be: scaling the system, security under load, iot device and compatibility.
So we developed a lighting control and hvac control using python in normal compiler... it calculates and give temperature data so that we will know about how we are using the sufficient temperature of electricity in our buildings.
